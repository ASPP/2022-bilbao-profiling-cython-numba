This is a very simple package that uses Cython.
It shows how to "package" a Python package with compiled sources.

The source code is just the .pyx file (integrate_f6.pyx).

The other files are "metadata":
- pyproject.toml
- meson.build
- setup.py

The "new" way is to use pip:
  pip wheel .

This creates a binary "wheel" (zip archive) in dist/ .

The "old" way is to use setup.py:
  python setup.py build
or
  python setup.py build_ext --inplace
to compile the code.

Load the resulting module in the python interpreter.
Call the integrate_f6() function.

--

Optionally:

Meson can also be invoked without pip:
  meson build-meson
  meson compile -C build-meson

Load the resulting module in the python interpreter.
Call the integrate_f6() function.
